            <h1>Module 03: Matrices and Data Frames</h1>

            This week's module was difficult. I continuously ran into errors with the prescribed operations in the assignment. While I worked around some of them, I was unable to complete
            certain portions due to these unrelenting errors. 
            <br><br>
            The most challenging portion was the matrix multiplication, as attempting to multiply a matrix is impossible to my knowledge with the dataset provided, unless the names column is taken away in order for the 
            matrix to recognize the numbers as integers. With this in mind, I attempted to recreate the example provided in the assignment, but could not for the life of me figure out how to make as.matrix(C.df)%*%B produce
            anything other than errors. The error I kept receiving is shown below: 
            <img src = "images/module_03_01.JPG">
            <br><br>
            I did end up successfully obtaining the resulting matrix, but had to use a different method of multiplication by turning C.df into a matrix called C.m, then typing C.m * 1010101.
            <br><br>
            The only other error I consistently ran into was with finding the mean of data frames, as my version of R obstinantly refused to offer a value, printing out the message seen below:
            <img src = "images/module_03_02.JPG">
            <br><br>
            If you see anything I did faulty to receive these errors please let me know, as of now I am unable to see what I have done wrong.

        <p>
            For this homework assignment, the task was to test a function posted in Canvas and identify it's possible errors. 
            I ran the function with the predetermined dataset (the vector object named assignment2) and R-Studio returned the following error:
            <img src="images/module_02_01.JPG">
            <br>
            This error appears because the 'myMean' function calls upon two nonexistent data objects in its mean and length functions. It calls upon 
            an object named "assignment" in its mean function, and it calls upon an object named "someData" in its length function. For the myMean function to 
            properly compute the mean of "assignment2", it needs to call upon "assignment2" in both the mean and length functions within it.
            <br>
            I fixed the errors and wrote a new function named "myWorkingMean" that properly computes the mean of "assignment2", shown below:
            <img src="images/module_02_02.JPG"> 
            <br>
            I also tested the result of "myWorkingMean" against R's built in "mean" function, and they returned the same values. This can be seen in the image above.
            <br>
            <br>
            The full R file for this module can be viewed and downloaded below. The "myMean" function had to be commented out to successfully compile the file since it runs an error.

            This is my first homework post for R programming in graduate school, very excited to be here!

            With the instruction in this week's module I successfully configured github so I can now use the command line to 
            update my repository, shown below.
