            <h1>Module 06: More Matrices in R</h1>

            The readings this week were interesting, I enjoyed learning the overall process of creating an R package. The introduction to object-oriented programming in R with the differences
            between S3 and S4 was cool as well.  
            <br><br>
            This week's assignment was fairly simple, I found the diag() function in R to be very straight forward. Adding and subtracting matrices was also much easier to understand than 
            multiplying them.
            <br><br>
            Question 1 first required the creation of two square matrices.

            <img src="images/module_06_002.png">
            Then some simple addition and subtraction operations with the newly created matrices.
            <img src="images/module_06_02.png">
            Question 2 required the creation of a 4 column, 4 row matrix with the values 4,1,2,3 in the diagonal, using the diag() function.
            <img src="images/module_06_03.png">
            Question 3 required the creation of a 5 column, 5 row matrix with 3's filling up the diagonal, 2's filling up the rest of the first column, and 1's filling up the rest of the first row.
            The example provided is below:
            <img src="images/module_06_04.png">
            I first generated a 5x5 identity matrix with 3's in the diagonal using the diag() function.
            <img src="images/module_06_05.png">
            I then created another 5x5 matrix, this time with zeros everywhere except the 1's and 2's required in the first row and first column.
            I used matrix(c(0,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0), ncol=5).
            <img src="images/module_06_06.png">
            Finally I added the two matrices together, getting the desired result.
