            <h1>Module 05: Matrices in R</h1>

            This assignment focused on learning about using matrices in R programming. The initial task was to 
            find the inverse and determinant of two matrices named A and B. A was a 10 column, 10 row matrix with values from 
            1 to 100. B was a 10 row, 100 column matrix with values from 1 to 1000. 
            <br><br>
            I generated the two matrices using the matrix() function in R, assigning them to variables A and B. 
            <img src="images/module_05_01.png">
            I then found the determinants for both matrices using the det() function in R. The determinant of A was 
            0, and the determinant of B couldn't be found because it was a non-square matrix.
            <img src="images/module_05_02.png">
            I then used the solve() function in R to find the inverse values of the two matrices. Matrix A did not have an inverse
            because it was "exactly singular", and matrix B did not have a clear inverse once again because it was non-square.

            In the second portion of the assignment outlined in the Announcement on Canvas, several matrix calculations were required. 
            <br><br>            
            Using the same matrices, A and B, the first step was transposing them using the t() function in R.
            <img src="images/module_05_04.png">
            The next step was to create two vectors. I purposefully made sure that each vector, a and b, had either 10 or 100 values
            so that they would better align with matrices A and B for multiplication using the %*% argument. 
            <img src="images/module_05_05.png">
            Next we had to test matrix multiplication using the %*% argument with matrices A and B, and vectors a and b. 
            Matrix A and vector a were able to be multiplied in any order, since the length of vector a is 10 and matrix A has both 10
            columns and 10 rows.
            <img src="images/module_05_06.png">
            Matrix B and vector b could only be multiplied without error when matrix B was placed before vector b. This is because matrix B has the same number of columns, 100, as vector b has values, also 100.
            When vector b comes before matrix B in the calculation (b %*% B), R returns an error because the values of vector b don't equal the number of rows in matrix B, which is 10.
            <img src="images/module_05_07.png">
            The final task was finding the inverse of a square matrix with two columns, two rows, and values 2 through 5. The matrix was generated using the matrix() function
            in R, the determinant was found with the det() function, and the inverse was found with the solve() function. 
            <img src="images/module_05_08.png">
            Before this assignment I was very unfamiliar with matrices, so this was a good help in learning the basics of their use and general terminology. I ended up reading about matrix multiplication
            online to understand what exactly the computer is doing when using the %*% argument, as I was not previously exposed to matrices in any math classes prior to this course.

            Looking forward to progressing towards building an R package!
