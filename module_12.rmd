This week's module covered the basics of R-Markdown, which is R-Studio's built-in 
application for publishing beautifully formatted documents with embedded code and 
visuals. 

There are a **ton** of different *options* for both formatting characters, numbers
(1^2^3^4^5), and code chunks. 

In-line code lets you embed dynamic calculations into sentences. For example, I can say
that the square root of pi is `r sqrt(3.1415926535)` without breaking a sweat.

You can also upload ![](images.png)

HTML elements can be used, such as the line break (hr) element.

*But you probably won't want to do it like that...*

Below is a quick example of an embedded visualization using ggplot2. `r library(ggplot2)` 

```{r} 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, hp, col=hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Weight and Horsepower Distribution", x="Weight", y="Horsepower") +
  theme_light()
```

## Conclusion

R-markdown is a powerful and versatile tool for sharing your work with others in the 
R community. I enjoyed playing around with it this week, and look forward to learning
about Shiny Apps in Module 13.
